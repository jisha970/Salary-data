# Salary-data
A real-world inspired salary dataset for practicing data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques.
# 📊 Salary Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates **Single Variable Linear Regression** using a salary dataset to analyze and predict employee salary based on **Years of Experience**. The goal is to understand the linear relationship between experience and income and build a simple predictive model.

This project is ideal for learning the fundamentals of regression, model evaluation, and data visualization.

## 📁 Dataset Description

- **Dataset:** Salary Data
- **Target Variable (Y):** Salary
- **Independent Variable (X):** Years of Experience
- **Total Records:** 375
- **File Format:** CSV

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement
> Can an employee’s salary be predicted using only their years of professional experience?

To answer this, a **simple linear regression model** is trained and evaluated.

---

## 📊 Features Used

| Variable | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Years of Experience** | Independent variable used for prediction |
| **Salary** | Dependent variable (target) |

All other features in the dataset are intentionally excluded to maintain a **single-variable regression** approach.

---

## 🧠 Methodology
1. Load and inspect the dataset  
2. Select **Years of Experience** as the independent variable  
3. Perform train-test split  
4. Train a Single Variable Linear Regression model  
5. Evaluate model performance  
6. Visualize the regression line

## 📐 Model Used
- **Algorithm:** Linear Regression  
- **Type:** Supervised Learning  
- **Category:** Regression  

---

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
The model performance can be evaluated using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score

---

## 📊 Visualization
The project includes visualizations such as:
- Scatter plot of Years of Experience vs Salary
- Regression line showing predicted salary trend
